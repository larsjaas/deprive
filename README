deprive - an object file link dependency analysis tool

When refactoring or working on design-related issues on large-scale C/C++ projects,
knowing the inter-dependencies between the components in the overall system is very
important.  This tool is designed to help you get various views of those dependencies.

The first step is to do an object file scan.  This process can take some time.  The
resulting data from this scan should therefore be stored so it can be loaded on later
invokations.

When you have scanned the object files, you can start doing interesting things.  But
first you have to wait for me to port that functionality over from some write-once
perl I once wrote...
